# ðŸŽ§ Podcast Feed Generator

## Overview
In this project, we create a podcast feed that podcast apps can use to get information about a show and its episodes. A podcast feed is an XML file in RSS format, which can be difficult to create manually. To make this easier, we use the YAML format to write podcast information and a Python script to convert it into RSS XML. GitHub Actions automate this process, and GitHub Pages is used to host the generated feed for free.
